I am pursuing my **PhD in Computer Science** @ [University Of Maryland - Baltimore County](https://www.umbc.edu/) in the [Dept. of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/).

I work as a **Research Assistant** to [Prof. Tim Oates](https://coral-lab.umbc.edu/oates/) in the [CORAL Lab](https://coral-lab.umbc.edu/) and work with **Graph Neural Networks for deep learning model classification and adversarial model detection**. My past research includes using traditional CNN architectures and NLP techniques for **Grounding Language using Visual Percepts**.


I am open to internship opportunities as a ML/AI Intern or in a research position.
I am also open to collaborate on research projects or paper ideas. 
You can reach me at the email.
