    abstract={People identify man-made objects by their visual appearance and the text on them e.g., does a bottle say water or shampoo? We use text as an important visual cue to help distinguish between similar looking objects. This thesis explores a novel joint model of visual appearance and textual cues for image classification.We perform this in three functions - (a) Isolating an object in an input image; (b) Extracting text from the image; (c) Training a joint vision/text model. We simplify the task by extracting text separately and presenting it to the model in machine readable format. Such a joint model has utility in many real world challenges where language is interpreted through a sensory perception like vision or sound.The aim of the research is to understand whether visual percepts, when understood in the context of extracted language, will provide a better classification of image objects than using only pure vision to perform image classification. In conclusion, we show that joint classifier models can successfully make use of text present in images to classify objects, provided that the extracted text from images is of high quality and we have the number of images proportional to the number of classification classes.},

    abstract={Forecasting is the process of making predictions of the future based on past and present data and most commonly by analysis of trends. Sales forecasting is the process of estimating future sales. To make informed business decisions and predict short-term and long-term performance an accurate sales forecast is a must. Promotions and targeted marketing is used by many businesses to increase the demand for or visibility of their product. Such promotions normally require increased expenses, loss of revenue and maybe additional costs. But having incurred all the financial and nonfinancial losses business owners need to determine the value and benefit of these promotions. So one way to evaluate promotions is to analyze the historical data using time series analysis techniques. This paper briefly explores time series analysis for promotional and base level forecasting.},

  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
